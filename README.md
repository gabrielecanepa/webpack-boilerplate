Simple webpack starter with the following configuration:

-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io) with [the latest preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [base Airbnb configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)
-   [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) and modules import to enjoy hot reloading
-   [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to easily deploy on GitHub Pages

## Usage

> ðŸ’¡ Want to be able to run a new, up-to-date boilerplate with a command as simple as `webpack:init`?
> Check out **[webpack-init](https://github.com/gabrielecanepa/webpack-init)**, and bootstrap a new project in seconds ðŸ“¦âœ¨ðŸ‘Œ

Clone the repository on your computer. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (> v4) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) installed:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabrielecanepa/webpack-boilerplate.git my-webpack-project
cd my-webpack-project
rm -rf .git
yarn install

Make sure you have `./node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`. This way you can run your server with:

```bash
webpack-dev-server
```
